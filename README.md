# NightMareAttack

## Intro

NightmareAttack is a 2D side scrolling FPS where you incarnate the body of Sleeper, our hero, who have to fight against the monster in his nightmare

Originally, this is a 30h Unity tuto in C# that i've followed and improved. You'll find the basic aspect of the game ( which was a FPS with a health system  ) and the improvement that i made :

- Created a 3D modelization of a bullet / landmine + explosion / Health Icon .
- Created an interaction upon collision of those item, the bullet increase the overall bullet damage, the landmine deals damage in AoE, and the health Icon give health back
- PS4 controller support

## Controls

This game support a mouse / PS4 controller


MOUSE
W/A/S/D for your typical player movement
M for landing a mine
Right click to fire

PS4
Right joystick to move
Left joystick to aim
Square for landing a mine
Right Trigger to fire

## Known bugs

- Due to the fact that a PS4 controller using Bluetooth VS directly linked to the computer does not trigger the same kind of events, i can only guarantee the correct use of the game via a mouse or a directly plugged PS4 controller
